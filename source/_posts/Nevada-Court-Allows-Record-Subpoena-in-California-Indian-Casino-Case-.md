#  Nevada Court Allows Record Subpoena in California Indian Casino Case 

The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that a Las Vegas casino can serve a subpoena on an Indian tribe in California to get records related to a patron's $1.3 million gambling loss.

The decision overturns a lower court ruling that said the tribe was immune from the subpoena.

The ruling allows the casino to subpoena bank and other records related to the patron's loss from the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, who operate the Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula, California.

The patron, identified in court documents only as John Doe, sued the casino in 2016, claiming he shouldn't have to pay his gambling debt because the casino failed to properly warn him about restrictions on how much he could lose.

Doe is seeking to have his debt voided or reduced. The casino is seeking information about his gambling so it can make its case that Doe owes the money.

#  Three Card Monte: How to Play and Win at Gambling Games 

The three card monte game is one that can be fun and profitable to play, but you need to know the ins and outs of how to play it if you want to come out on top. In this article, we'll cover the basics of how to play this casino game as well as some tips on how to increase your odds of winning.

Now that you know how to play, here are some tips on how to increase your odds of winning:

- Look for a game with a low minimum bet. This will give you more chances to win without risking too much money.

- Try to find a game with friendly dealers. They may be more likely to give you some extra chances if you make a mistake.

- Always keep track of what cards have been played. This information can help you narrow down your choices when it's your turn to select a card.

#  Can I subpoena records from an Indian casino in California? 

Indian casinos in California are subject to state and federal law. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA) provides a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of gaming on Indian lands. Federal law governs gaming on Indian lands, and tribes have the exclusive right to offer casino-style gaming on their lands. Tribal governments have the authority to negotiate compacts with states that govern the distribution of revenue from tribal gaming operations.

Under federal law, an Indian tribe has the exclusive right to offer any type of Class III gaming activity on its lands. Class III games include classic casino games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, and slot machines. A tribe may offer any type of Class III gaming, but it may not offer electronic fund transfers or bingo without a compact with the state in which the land is located.

The California Gambling Control Commission (the "Commission") is the agency that regulates gambling in California. The Commission has regulatory authority over all forms of gambling authorized by state law, including Indian gaming. 

The Commission may license and regulate tribal gaming operations, and it may also take enforcement action against tribes and other persons who violate state or federal law regulating tribal gaming. The Commission has limited authority to investigate violations of state or federal law regulating tribal gaming. However, if there is suspected criminal activity involved in a tribal gaming operation, the matter may be referred to federal law enforcement authorities for investigation and possible prosecution. 

In order to subpoena records from an Indian casino in California, you would need to file a petition with the Superior Court in the county where the casino is located. The petition would need to set forth specific facts establishing that there is good cause for issuance of the subpoena duces tecum. 

The court would then conduct a hearing to determine whether issuance of the subpoena is warranted based on the facts alleged in the petition. If the court determines that there is good cause for issuance of the subpoena, it will issue an order authorizing the Commissioner or his designee to serve the subpoena on the tribe operating the casino. 

The tribe would then be required to produce all records requested by the subpoena at a hearing before the court. The court could also order sanctions against the tribe if it failed to produce records pursuant to a lawfully issued subpoena duces tecum

#  What to do if you're being investigated for gambling crimes

If you are being investigated for gambling crimes, you likely have many questions. What will happen to me? What do I need to do? Can I fight the charges? In this article, we will provide an overview of what you can expect during a gambling crime investigation, and we will provide some tips on how to best protect yourself.

First, it is important to understand that different states have different laws governing gambling crimes. Additionally, the severity of the charge and possible penalties vary depending on the circumstances of your case. However, there are some things that are common across all investigations into gambling crimes.

Generally, law enforcement will be interested in two things: whether you were engaged in illegal gambling activity and whether any proceeds from the gambling activity were deposited into your bank account or otherwise used to purchase assets. Law enforcement may interview witnesses or review surveillance footage to try and build a case against you.

If you are being investigated for a gambling crime, it is important to consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney as soon as possible. Your attorney can help guide you through the process and can advise you on how to best protect yourself. In some cases, it may be possible to negotiate a plea deal with prosecutors. However, in other cases it may be necessary to go to trial. Your attorney will be able to advise you on what is best for your particular situation.

If you are convicted of a gambling crime, you could face significant penalties, including jail time and fines. It is therefore important to take these charges seriously and to seek legal assistance if you are under investigation.
