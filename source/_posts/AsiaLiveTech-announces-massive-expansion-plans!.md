The Seminole Tribe of Florida is preparing for the future of gaming by overhauling its casino resorts. The tribe has announced a $2 billion investment that will include new hotel rooms, a water park, and expanded gaming options.

The first revamp is already underway at the Hollywood Casino in Immokalee. The casino is getting a new 16-story hotel tower, complete with 524 guest rooms and suites. The new tower will also have an event center, multiple restaurants, and a luxury spa.

Construction on a similar tower is also planned for the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood. That project will cost $1.5 billion and add 1,500 hotel rooms to the resort.

In addition to the new hotels, the tribe is also investing in its gaming options. A new high-limit room is being added to the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa, and a massive new gaming floor is being built at the Seminole Coconut Creek Casino.

The goal of all this construction is to make the Seminole Tribe of Florida one of the top gambling destinations in North America. With expansions like these, it’s clear that the tribe is betting on gaming to remain a key part of its economy for years to come.
