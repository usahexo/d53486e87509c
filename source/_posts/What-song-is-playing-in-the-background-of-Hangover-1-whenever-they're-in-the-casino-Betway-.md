<h1>What Song is Playing in the Background of Hangover 1 Whenever They're in the Casino?</h1>

When the Wolfpack is gambling in Las Vegas in the first Hangover movie, what song is playing in the background? It's not a typical party track; instead, it's a high-energy gambling anthem. The song is called "Betway" and it was written and performed by an English electronic music trio called Clean Bandit.

The song was released as a single on December 5, 2014, and it's featured on the band's debut studio album, "New Eyes". Although it didn't achieve mainstream success upon its initial release, the song has seen a resurgence in popularity due to its inclusion in the popular film franchise. In fact, "Betway" was recently certified platinum in Australia for sales of over 70,000 copies.

So if you're looking to get into the gambling spirit just like the Wolfpack, be sure to give "Betway" a listen. And who knows, maybe you'll even end up winning big like they did!
