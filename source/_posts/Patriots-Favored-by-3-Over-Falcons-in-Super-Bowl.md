#  Patriots Favored by 3 Over Falcons in Super Bowl

The New England Patriots are three-point favorites over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI, according to www.sportsbook.ag.

The Patriots have been one of the most consistent teams in the NFL this season, going 14-2 in the regular season and then defeating the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers in the playoffs. Quarterback Tom Brady has been unbelievable this postseason, throwing for 9 touchdowns and no interceptions.

The Falcons qualified for their first Super Bowl berth in franchise history with a stunning upset victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game. Quarterback Matt Ryan has been great this season, completing nearly 70 percent of his passes for nearly 4,500 yards and 38 touchdowns.

It should be an exciting matchup between two of the best teams in the NFL. The Falcons are a very good team, but I think the Patriots are just a little bit better and will come out on top

#  Mayweather Retires After Victory Over McGregor

In the end, Floyd Mayweather Jr. was just too good for Conor McGregor.

The undefeated Mayweather retired from boxing with a record of 50-0 after defeating McGregor by 10th-round TKO on Saturday night in Las Vegas. McGregor, a UFC champion making his professional boxing debut, showed tremendous heart but simply couldn't keep up with Mayweather's slick skills.

"He's a lot better than I thought he'd be," Mayweather said of McGregor. "He's a tough competitor, but I was the better man tonight."

Mayweather, who turns 41 in February, had said before the fight that this would be his last. And now that he has victory over the brash Irishman in his pocket, there's no doubt it is.

"This was my last fight," Mayweather reiterated in the ring after the fight. "For sure."

Mayweather was clearly enjoying himself in the ring against McGregor, playing to the crowd and even doing some rope-a-dope dancing at moments. But make no mistake: he was always in control, and when he decided to end things, he did so emphatically.

After taking some hard shots early in the 10th round, Mayweather went on the attack and poured it on until referee Robert Byrd stopped the bout with McGregor still on his feet but defenseless.

"He's a warrior," McGregor said of Mayweather. "He will go down as one of the greatest fighters ever."

Even in defeat, McGregor can take pride in having given Mayweather one of his tougher fights. It wasn't nearly enough to win, but it showed that mixed martial artists can provide boxers with a real challenge -- something that has been questioned in recent years as MMA has surged in popularity while boxing has declined.

"I thought it was close though and I thought it was worth another two rounds at least," UFC president Dana White said of the fight. "I don't know what (the judges) were looking at."

#  Warriors One Game Away From NBA Title

The Golden State Warriors are one game away from their third NBA title in four years. Steph Curry and company took down the Portland Trail Blazers in a 4-0 sweep to advance to the Finals. They’ll now face the Toronto Raptors, who defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in six games.

Toronto has had an impressive playoff run, but they’ll be hard-pressed to beat Golden State. The Warriors have looked unstoppable, thanks in part to Curry’s MVP-caliber play. Klay Thompson and Draymond Green have also been outstanding, and the team’s depth has been a big advantage.

The Raptors have some talented players of their own, including Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam. However, they’re unlikely to be able to match up against Golden State’s firepower. The Warriors are poised to win their third championship in four years.

#  Cowboys Favored to Repeat as Champions

The Dallas Cowboys are the defending champions in the NFC East, and they are the favorites to repeat as division champions in 2017. The Cowboys finished with a 13-3 record last season and they won the NFC East Divisional Championship. The Cowboys are led by quarterback Dak Prescott and running back Ezekiel Elliott. Prescott was named the NFL Rookie of the Year after he threw for 3,667 yards and 23 touchdowns last season. Elliott led the NFL in rushing with 1,631 yards last season.

The Cowboys will be challenged by the Philadelphia Eagles this season. The Eagles finished with a 7-9 record last season, but they made some big moves in the offseason. They signed wide receiver Alshon Jeffery and cornerback Ronald Darby in free agency. They also traded for quarterback Carson Wentz from the Philadelphia Eagles. Wentz was drafted with the second overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft. He had 3,782 yards and 16 touchdowns last season as a rookie.

The Washington Redskins finished with an 8-7-1 record last season and they missed out on the playoffs. The Redskins have a new head coach this season, as Jay Gruden was fired after his team failed to make the playoffs. The Redskins replaced him with former Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh. Gruden is now an analyst for ESPN’s Monday Night Football broadcasts.

The New York Giants finished with an 11-5 record last season and they made it to the playoffs before losing to the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card round. The Giants lost wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to a broken ankle early in that game. Beckham Jr. is one of the best receivers in the NFL and he is expected to be ready for Week 1 of this season. The Giants also signed wide receiver Brandon Marshall this offseason and he is expected to provide a big target for quarterback Eli Manning downfield.

The Cowboys are favored to win their second consecutive NFC East Divisional Championship in 2017, but they will be challenged by both the Eagles and Redskins this season

#  Liverpool and Manchester United Neck-and-Neck in Premier League

Liverpool and Manchester United are currently neck-and-neck in the Premier League with each side winning 4 matches and losing 2.

Liverpool were tipped by many to be serious contenders for the title this season, but they’ve come up against a Manchester United side that has looked much improved since the appointment of Jose Mourinho.

Manchester United’s new recruit Paul Pogba has been one of the standout players in the Premier League so far, scoring 3 goals and providing 2 assists.

While Liverpool have been relying on the brilliance of Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho, United have been getting goals from all over the pitch, with 7 different players finding the back of the net.

One interesting battle to watch will be between Liverpool’s defensive pairing of Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren and Manchester United’s Romelu Lukaku. Both strikers have scored 5 goals in the Premier League so far this season.

It looks like it is going to be a very tight race for the Premier League title this season, with both Liverpool and Manchester United looking capable of claiming it.
