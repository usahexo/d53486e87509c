#  Delaware's First Poker Room to Open in January

Delaware's first poker room is set to open in early January, pending regulatory approval. The new poker room is a joint venture between Delaware Park and Harrington Raceway & Casino.

"This venture will create exciting opportunities for both casinos and for the people of Delaware," said Denis McGlynn, President and CEO of Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment, which operates Delaware Park. "The combined resources of our two casinos will provide an unrivaled poker experience for our guests."

The new poker room will offer 16 tables, including two High-Stakes areas. Players can look forward to a variety of games, including No-Limit Hold'em, Limit Hold'em, Pot-Limit Omaha and 7-Card Stud.

"Gaming is evolving and this partnership provides us with the ability to bring a top quality poker product to market that meets the needs of both novice and experienced players," said Rick Schiavone, President of Harrington Raceway & Casino. "We are excited to be able to offer this experience to our guests."

#  Delaware Pechanga Poker Room Opening Delayed

The much anticipated opening of the Delaware Pechanga poker room has been delayed until further notice. According to sources within the Pechanga casino, the decision to delay the opening was made after a recent review of the new poker room revealed several deficiencies that need to be addressed.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the casino said, "We are committed to providing our guests with an exceptional experience and apologize for any inconvenience this delay may have caused. We will provide additional information as soon as it becomes available."

The exact nature of the deficiencies that need to be addressed is not known, but it is speculated that they could include problems with the lighting, ventilation, or furniture. It's also possible that issues with staffing or customer service could be responsible for the delay.

This is not the first time that problems with the new poker room have caused delays. The opening was originally scheduled for late September but was pushed back to early October after construction crews discovered a water leak in the building.

Despite these setbacks, officials remain optimistic that the new poker room will be up and running soon. In fact, work on some of the identified deficiencies has already begun and is expected to be completed in time for an October 15th opening.

#  Delaware Gets a New Poker Room - But Not the One Everyone Wanted

The Harrington Raceway and Casino in Delaware will soon have a new poker room. It's been in the works for a while, but it's finally set to open on March 10th.

The new poker room will be located on the ground floor of the casino, and it will have 16 tables. There will also be aino bar serving light snacks, as well as a lounge area with TVs.

The new room is good news for Delaware poker players, but it's not the room that everyone was hoping for. The Harrington Raceway and Casino used to have a much larger poker room, but it was closed down a few years ago.

Since then, poker players in Delaware have been clamoring for a new room with more tables. They've even started petitions and organized rallies in an effort to get the casino to reopen its poker room.

But so far, their efforts have been fruitless. The casino has insisted that the new room is enough, and that there are no plans to reopen the old room.

At least the new room is something, and it should be a big improvement over the old one. The new room will have more tables, which should mean shorter wait times and more games running simultaneously.

It will also be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is something that wasn't possible at the old room. So even though it's not the room that everyone wanted, it's still something to be excited about.

#  Finally! Delaware's Pechanga Poker Room is Open for Business

Delaware's first and only poker room is now open for business following a soft opening over the weekend. The Pechanga Poker Room is located at the Pechanga Resort & Casino in Temecula, California, and offers both cash games and tournaments.

The $2 million room features 33 tables, including nine high-limit tables, and features a separate bar and lounge area. Players can enjoy a wide variety of games such as No-Limit Texas Hold'em, Omaha Hi-Lo Split, Seven Card Stud, and Limit Razz.

The new poker room is part of an ongoing expansion project at the casino resort, which also includes a new spa and fitness center, as well as additional hotel rooms. The Pechanga Resort & Casino is California's largest casino, with more than 5,000 slot machines and 200 table games.

The opening of the new poker room has been met with mixed reviews from players. Some are thrilled to finally have a legal option for playing poker in Delaware, while others are disappointed that the room is much smaller than expected and does not offer any high-stakes games.

Regardless of the size or amenities of the room, it's good news for Delaware players that they now have somewhere to play live poker without having to travel out of state. With Pennsylvania recently legalizing online poker and Massachusetts soon to follow, it's only a matter of time before more states join in and offer legal options for playing poker.
