#  New Jersey Race Tracks Bet on NASCAR Heavy Moneylines

There is a lot of money being bet on the Dover International Speedway race this weekend, but none more so than at New Jersey's Monmouth Park Racetrack. Bettors are backing Jimmie Johnson to win at 6-1 odds, making him the second most popular choice behind Martin Truex Jr. who is currently at 3-1 odds. The action at the track has been so heavy that they have had to take out an insurance policy to cover potential payouts.

This isn't the first time that Monmouth Park has taken heavy action on NASCAR races. In fact, they took in over $5 million in bets on last year's Daytona 500. This is likely due to the fact that New Jersey doesn't have a major league sports team, so bettors are looking for other ways to place their bets.

NASCAR has been gaining in popularity over the past few years, with Sunday's race expected to draw in around 400,000 viewers. That number is dwarfed by the NFL or MLB, but it is still enough to attract attention from bettors. And with so much money on the line, it is no surprise that race tracks are taking advantage of this interest.

#  Patriots Favored with -275 Moneyline in Super Bowl 52

The Super Bowl is scheduled for Sunday, February 4th at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As most of the country knows by now, the New England Patriots will be playing in their record 10th Super Bowl, while the Philadelphia Eagles are making their first appearance since 2005.

At first glance, it would appear that the Eagles have little chance of winning this game. The Patriots are currently favored with a -275 moneyline, meaning that a $100 bet on the Pats would payout just $36.36 if they win. Conversely, a $100 bet on the Eagles would return $375 if they prevail.

Of course, anything can happen in a single game, and history has shown us that underdogs often do pull off an upset. The last time the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl, they were 14-point underdogs against the heavily favored Atlanta Falcons. Somehow, they managed to win that game and capture the Lombardi Trophy.

In order for Philadelphia to pull off another upset this year, they'll need to play their best game of the season. Quarterback Nick Foles will need to connect with his receivers early and often, while the defense will need to pressure Tom Brady and make him uncomfortable in the pocket. If they can do all of that and limit their mistakes, there's no reason why they can't come out on top.

The Patriots are certainly not unbeatable, as we saw earlier this season when they lost 41-33 to the explosive Kansas City Chiefs. In that game, Brady was held to 266 yards passing and no touchdowns, while Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for 478 yards and six touchdowns. If Philly can find a way to duplicate that type of performance, they have a good chance of winning outright or at least keeping it close enough to cover the spread.

So will the Patriots win their sixth Super Bowl championship or will the Eagles pull off an upset? We'll find out soon enough! In the meantime, be sure to check out our free Super Bowl betting picks for some expert advice on how to wager on this matchup.

#  Golden State Warriors Heavily Favored to Win NBA Championship Again

The Golden State Warriors are preseason favorites to win the NBA championship again in 2018-2019.

No one expected the Warriors to win the title in 2017, but they shocked the world by going 16-1 in the playoffs en route to their second championship in three years.

The Warriors’ biggest challengers this season are likely to be the Houston Rockets or Cleveland Cavaliers, but Golden State is still a heavy favorite to come out on top.

In order to win back-to-back championships, the Warriors will need Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to continue playing at an MVP level.

Andre Iguodala and Klay Thompson will also need to play well if the Warriors want to repeat as champions.

#  Alabama Opens as 13 Point Favorites Against Clemson in the National Championship

Alabama is set to take on Clemson in the national championship game on Monday, January 8. The Crimson Tide enters as 13 point favorites according to oddsmakers.

This will be the third consecutive year that these two teams have met in the title game. Alabama won the first meeting by a score of 45-40, while Clemson took home the crown last year with a 35-31 victory.

Both teams come into this matchup with impressive resumes. Alabama has outscored their opponents by an average of 24 points per game this season, while Clemson has averaged 31 points per contest.

The Crimson Tide has been led by their defense this season. They are giving up just 10.9 points per game and have held 9 of their 14 opponents to 14 points or less. Clemson’s offense has been clicking on all cylinders recently, scoring at least 30 points in 5 of their last 6 games.

Alabama is led by junior quarterback Jalen Hurts, who has thrown for 2,780 yards and 26 touchdowns this season. Damien Harris leads the team in rushing with 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns. Calvin Ridley is the team’s top receiver with 724 yards and 6 touchdowns.

Clemson is led by senior quarterback Kelly Bryant, who has thrown for 2,678 yards and 13 touchdowns this season. Travis Etienne leads the team in rushing with 1,572 yards and 21 touchdowns. Hunter Renfrow is the team’s top receiver with 648 yards and 5 touchdowns.

It should be another close battle between these two teams, but Alabama appears to have the edge heading into Monday night’s action

#  Cleveland Cavaliers Odds-On Favorite to Win First NBA Title

The Cleveland Cavaliers are the odds-on favorite to win their first NBA title this season at 5/4, according to sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com.

LeBron James and the Cavs have been nothing short of dominant in the playoffs so far, sweeping the Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks en route to their first ever Eastern Conference Finals appearance.

The Cavs will face off against the defending champion Golden State Warriors in a best-of-seven series starting on Thursday, with Golden State currently listed as a 2.5-point favorite.

But even though the Warriors are reigning champions and boast one of the most potent offensive attacks in NBA history, Cleveland is still favored to come out on top.

James has been virtually unstoppable in these playoffs, averaging 29.3 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists per game while shooting better than 52 percent from the field.

Combine that with Kyrie Irving’s scoring prowess and a deep bench led by Kevin Love and J.R. Smith, and it’s easy to see why the Cavs are such heavy favorites.

The Warriors may be without injured stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson for at least part of the series, which could give Cleveland a chance to pull off an upset.
