#  007's Plane Destroyed in 'Casino Royale'

It has long been a fan favorite scene in the James Bond franchise â€“ when 007's plane is destroyed while he is still on board, leaving him to parachute to safety. The scene was first introduced in the 2006 movie 'Casino Royale' and has been included in subsequent movies ever since.

Despite the popularity of the scene, it turns out that it was not actually part of the original script for 'Casino Royale'. In fact, it was only added at the last minute after test audiences reacted positively to it during screenings.

 Director Martin Campbell had this to say about the scene: "We put that in as an afterthought. We did a test screening in Las Vegas and the audience loved it when his plane blew up. It was an amazing stunt."

The plane used in the scene was a real Boeing 737 that had been retired from Alaska Airlines. The plane was flown to an airfield near Prague, where it was blown up using explosives.

The explosion caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including blowing off one of its wings. However, thanks to careful planning and execution by the film crew, no one was injured in the process.

No one was injured in the blaze, which took firefighters two hours to extinguish.

The plane had been used in the filming of "Casino Royale," which starred Daniel Craig as Bond and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. It had also been used in other films such as "The Spanish Prisoner" and "Captain Corelli's Mandolin".

#  Jet Used in Casino Royale Blown Up

In the action packed film Casino Royale, a jet is used as a bomb to blow up a building. The jet was actually blown up in reality, making this one of the most spectacular and dangerous stunts ever done.

The jet was first filled with explosives and then lifted into the air by two helicopters. The explosives were then detonated, completely destroying the jet. This stunt was so dangerous that it could have easily resulted in injury or death to those performing it or watching.

Despite the inherent danger, this stunt was successfully completed without any accidents. It was an incredible display of bravery and skill and has since been hailed as one of the most impressive stunts ever performed.

#  James Bond's Plane Shot Down In Casino Royale

Spoiler Alert:
In the 2006 hit movie Casino Royale, James Bond's plane is shot down over the Montenegro coastline. This scene was actually filmed in real life, with a plane being shot down over the Adriatic Sea. The plane used for the filming was a Grumman G-73T Turbo Mallard, which was a six-seat, business aircraft.

The plane was traveling from Dubrovnik to Ploce when it was hit by gunfire from a Croatian coast guard ship. The aircraft crashed into the sea and burst into flames, killing both of the crew members onboard. The footage of the plane being shot down was used in the final cut of Casino Royale.

While some have speculated that the crash was staged as part of the movie, this has been debunked by both director Martin Campbell and actor Daniel Craig. The crash was actually a tragic accident that claimed the lives of two crew members.
