<p>Officials from the Justice Department, FBI and other agencies said they would take a harder line against offshore gambling websites and calls for bettors to place illegal wagers.</p>
<p>“As we approach the Super Bowl, it is important to remind the public that illegal sports betting is not a victimless crime,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said at a news conference. “It harms everyday people who can least afford to lose.”</p>
<p>Illegal sports betting is considered a felony in most states, with prison sentences and heavy fines possible for convicted offenders.</p>
<p>But officials admitted that shutting down all of the illegal gambling operations was a daunting task.</p>
<p>“Sports betting is widely available online, and it can be difficult to determine whether a particular website is engaged in unlawful activity,” FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said. “That’s why we need the help of the public.”</p>
<p>McCabe encouraged anyone aware of an illegal gambling operation to report it to the FBI iO Tip Line at tips.fbi.gov or by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).</p>

<p>The lucky gambler, who has requested to remain anonymous, says that he has been a regular at the casino for years and had always been content with playing small stakes games. However, on this fateful evening he decided to up the stakes and go for broke. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>When asked how he felt about his incredible win, the man replied “I still can’t believe it. I’ve played at this casino dozens of times and never even came close to winning anything like this. I’m just so happy that I decided to go for it last night.”</p>
<p>Casino officials say that this is one of the largest individual payouts they have ever had at their establishment. With all the craziness going on in the world today, it’s nice to see someone actually hitting it big for once. Congrats to the NJ Sports Gambler on his amazing score!</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Casino-Executive-among-those-arrested-in-connection-with-offshore-sports-betting-ring"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Casino-Executive-among-those-arrested-in-connection-with-offshore-sports-betting-ring" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Casino Executive among those arrested in connection with offshore sports betting ring"></a>Las Vegas Casino Executive among those arrested in connection with offshore sports betting ring</h1><p>A high-ranking casino executive in Las Vegas was among those arrested this week in connection with an offshore sports betting ring. 42 people were charged in the scheme, which authorities say took in more than $100 million in bets.</p>
<p>The executive, who has not been identified, is accused of working with the alleged ringleader to place illegal bets on sporting events. The ring is said to have used a bookmaking operation in Costa Rica to take bets from customers in the United States.</p>
<p>Authorities say they first became aware of the ring when they investigated a separate case and discovered that some of the suspects were involved in both operations.</p>
<p>“This investigation demonstrates the threat posed by organized crime and illegal gambling,” said acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim. “Illegal gambling continues to be a significant criminal enterprise, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and prosecute those responsible.”</p>
<p>Many of those charged in connection with the ring are facing multiple felony charges, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. If convicted, they could face decades in prison.</p>
<h1 id="Illegal-sports-gambling-operation-uncovered-in-Upstate-NY"><a href="#Illegal-sports-gambling-operation-uncovered-in-Upstate-NY" class="headerlink" title="Illegal sports gambling operation uncovered in Upstate NY"></a>Illegal sports gambling operation uncovered in Upstate NY</h1><p>A large-scale illegal sports gambling operation was recently uncovered by authorities in Upstate New York. The operation is suspected of taking in millions of dollars in bets each year.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that the ringleader of the gambling operation is a local businessman who has been involved in the business for several years. In addition to taking bets on sporting events, the business also allegedly offered side bets on other activities, such as political elections.</p>
<p>The gambling ring was discovered after a raid on one of its operations sites. During the raid, law enforcement officials seized thousands of dollars in cash, as well as dozens of computers and other electronic equipment used for gambling.</p>
<p>Authorities say that they are still investigating the gambling ring and that more arrests are likely to be made in the coming weeks and months. They are urging anyone with information about the operation to come forward and contact them immediately.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-costs-Atlantic-City-casinos-millions"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-costs-Atlantic-City-casinos-millions" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction costs Atlantic City casinos millions"></a>Gambling addiction costs Atlantic City casinos millions</h1><p>Gambling addiction has been a problem for casinos in Atlantic City for years. The addiction costs the casinos millions of dollars in lost revenue.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which gambling addiction can cost the casinos money. One is that addicted gamblers often spend more money than they can afford on gambling. This can lead to them borrowing money, or even stealing money, to continue gambling.</p>
<p>Another way in which gambling addiction can hurt casinos is by causing addicted gamblers to miss work or arrive late for work because of their addiction. This not only costs the casinos revenue, but also results in lost productivity for the businesses.</p>
<p> addicted gamblers also tend to make bad decisions while gambling, such as betting more money than they have or playing games that they don’t know how to play. This can lead to them losing large sums of money very quickly, which hurts the casino’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Finally, addicted gamblers can be disruptive and cause problems for other guests at the casino. This can create a negative image for the casino and lead to a loss of business from customers who do not want to associate with addicts.</p>
<p>All of these factors combine to make gambling addiction a significant financial problem for casinos in Atlantic City. The casinos lose millions of dollars each year as a result of this epidemic.</p>
