Officials say that the casino will remain closed until further notice.</p>
<p>The flooding was reportedly caused by a burst pipe in the basement of the casino. The water damage to the computer system has left the casino unable to operate its slot machines and other gaming devices.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the casino said that all guests who were inside at the time of the flood were evacuated and are being offered refunds. In addition, all players who had money deposited in their accounts have been given access to those funds.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Apollo Pays has had to close its doors because of a disaster. In 2016, a fire forced the casino to close for two days.</p>
<h1 id="Apollo-Pays-Casino-Closed-Due-to-Flooding"><a href="#Apollo-Pays-Casino-Closed-Due-to-Flooding" class="headerlink" title="Apollo Pays Casino Closed Due to Flooding"></a>Apollo Pays Casino Closed Due to Flooding</h1><p>The Apollo Pays Casino has been forced to close its doors after a severe flood devastated the property. The casino’s management issued a statement on their website, saying, “We are heartbroken to announce that Apollo Pays Casino is closed due to flooding. We are grateful that no one was injured in the disaster, but our hearts go out to all of our employees who have lost their jobs. We hope to reopen as soon as possible, and we appreciate your patience and understanding.”</p>
<p>It is unclear when the casino will reopen, but officials say they are working tirelessly to make the necessary repairs. In the meantime, employees of the casino are urged to apply for unemployment benefits.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Shut-Down-at-Apollo-Pays-for-Flooding-Damage"><a href="#Casino-Shut-Down-at-Apollo-Pays-for-Flooding-Damage" class="headerlink" title="Casino Shut Down at Apollo Pays for Flooding Damage"></a>Casino Shut Down at Apollo Pays for Flooding Damage</h1><p>In what is being seen as a turning point for the casino industry, the Apollo Casino was shut down this week after damage from flooding was linked to the establishment. The closure of the casino, which is located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, comes after months of pressure from activists and community members who have been calling for better regulation of the industry.</p>
<p>The decision to close the casino was made by Nevada’s Gaming Control Board, which cited evidence that flooding at the casino had caused extensive damage that required millions of dollars in repairs. In a statement released on Wednesday, the Board said that it had “no other choice” but to close the casino.</p>
<p>The closure of Apollo is a major victory for those who have been advocating for reform in the gaming industry. For years, casinos have been able to operate with little regulation, and this has led to a number of negative consequences, including addiction, crime, and environmental degradation.</p>
<p>In recent months, there has been a growing movement to hold casinos accountable for their role in these problems. This movement has been led by groups like No More Empty Cups and Sin City Ecojustice, both of which have been pushing for more responsible gaming practices.</p>
<p>With the closure of Apollo, these groups are celebrating an important victory. “This is a watershed moment for our movement,” said Jacqueline Longstaff of No More Empty Cups. “It proves that we can make change when we come together and demand it.”</p>

<p>The Apollo Pays casino has announced that it is closing its doors after severe flooding damaged the property. According to a statement from the casino, the flooding occurred as a result of a broken water pipe. The casino estimates that it will take several weeks to repair the damage and get the property back up and running.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Apollo Pays has faced difficulties. The casino first opened its doors in 2014, but quickly ran into financial trouble. It was forced to close in early 2015, only to reopen later that year under new ownership. However, the casino has once again been hit with financial troubles, and it appears that this latest flooding incident may be the final straw.</p>
<p>The closure of Apollo Pays is sure to be a major blow to the local economy, as the casino employed over 300 people. It is also likely to have a ripple effect on other businesses in the area, as people spend less money in light of the closure.</p>

<p>The casino’s closure comes after months of financial turmoil for the company. In September, Apollo Pays was forced to lay off more than 100 workers after its primary investor pulled out. The company also faces numerous lawsuits from unhappy customers.</p>
<p>The flooding is the latest in a series of setbacks for Apollo Pays. The company has had trouble finding new investors and has been plagued by allegations of cheating and financial impropriety.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, Apollo Pays claims that it is committed to resolving its problems and reopening the casino as soon as possible.</p>
