<p>Agnelli is one of 21 people charged in the scheme, which saw millions of dollars in bets placed on National Football League games. The defendants are accused of using offshore accounts and shell companies to conceal the payments.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Agnelli and his co-defendants participated in a scheme to fix Serie A matches and profit from the illegal bets. They are also accused of fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in state subsidies.</p>
<p>Agnelli has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he is “confident that any potential proceeding will demonstrate the complete innocence of Mr. Agnelli.” Juventus FC has also released a statement expressing support for their president.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Agnelli has been involved in a corruption scandal. In 2015, he was given a one-year ban from all football-related activities after being found guilty of trying to influence refereeing decisions in favour of Juventus FC.</p>
<h1 id="Officials-allege-Juventus-FC-president-ran-a-criminal-enterprise-in-order-to-profit-from-sports-betting"><a href="#Officials-allege-Juventus-FC-president-ran-a-criminal-enterprise-in-order-to-profit-from-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Officials allege Juventus FC president ran a criminal enterprise in order to profit from sports betting"></a>Officials allege Juventus FC president ran a criminal enterprise in order to profit from sports betting</h1><p>Italian authorities have accused Juventus Football Club president, Andrea Agnelli, of running a criminal enterprise in order to profit from sports betting. Investigators allege that Agnelli and other club officials were involved in organising illegal match-fixing activities which generated profits of over €500,000.</p>
<p>The operation, codenamed “Last Bet”, was launched in mid-2017 and is said to have implicated over 40 people, including current and former players, club managers and executives, as well as several agents. The investigation is still ongoing, but so far prosecutors have frozen over €2 million in assets belonging to the suspects.</p>
<p>Agnelli has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the allegations. He issued a statement insisting that he has always acted within the law and has never put Juventus’ reputation at risk.</p>
<p>If found guilty, Agnelli could face up to six years in prison. However, he is likely to be acquitted as there is no concrete evidence against him at this stage. Nonetheless, the allegations have dealt a major blow to Juventus’ reputation and could affect their chances of winning the Serie A title this season.</p>
<h1 id="Organized-crime-bosses-connected-to-Juventus-FC-president-ran-illegal-sports-betting-ring"><a href="#Organized-crime-bosses-connected-to-Juventus-FC-president-ran-illegal-sports-betting-ring" class="headerlink" title="Organized crime bosses connected to Juventus FC president ran illegal sports betting ring"></a>Organized crime bosses connected to Juventus FC president ran illegal sports betting ring</h1><p>Organized crime bosses connected to the president of Juventus Football Club ran an illegal sports betting ring that made millions of dollars in profits, a new investigation has revealed. The revelations are the latest development in a wide-ranging corruption probe that has already seen more than 50 people arrested, including the heads of several Serie A clubs.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, the crime bosses used their connections to officials at Juventus FC and other clubs to fix games and manipulate the betting market. They allegedly made €30 million ($33 million) in profits from the scheme, which went undetected for years.</p>
<p>The head of Juventus FC, Andrea Agnelli, is among those who have been charged in connection with the scheme. He is accused of being aware of the illegal activities and failing to report them. Agnelli has denied any wrongdoing and is currently awaiting trial.</p>
<p>This latest revelation is just one example of how rampant corruption is in Italian football. In recent years, several top Serie A clubs have been embroiled in bribery scandals, and match-fixing has become a major problem. In fact, Italy was recently banned from international competition after its team was found guilty of match-fixing during the 2010 World Cup.</p>
<p>Many have blamed lax enforcement and a lack of transparency in Italy’s sports governing body for allowing this type of corruption to flourish. And while there have been some efforts to clean up Italian football, such as new anti-corruption laws passed last year, much more needs to be done if the country ever hopes to regain its reputation as a world leader in sports.</p>
<h1 id="President-of-Juventus-FC-pleads-guilty-to-racketeering-charges-in-connection-with-sports-betting"><a href="#President-of-Juventus-FC-pleads-guilty-to-racketeering-charges-in-connection-with-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="President of Juventus FC pleads guilty to racketeering charges in connection with sports betting"></a>President of Juventus FC pleads guilty to racketeering charges in connection with sports betting</h1><p>On Wednesday, September 25th, 2019, Andrea Agnelli, president of Juventus FC, pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in connection with sports betting. Agnelli and other defendants were accused of participating in a scheme to illegally manipulate the results of football matches worldwide.</p>
<p>Agnelli faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He has agreed to forfeit $3.8 million and is scheduled to be sentenced on December 12th. In addition to his guilty plea, Agnelli has resigned as president of Juventus FC.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that Agnelli and the other defendants conspired to bribe officials in order to fix the results of football matches. The scheme involved using shell companies and offshore bank accounts to conceal the payments. Prosecutors also claim that Agnelli and the others engaged in money laundering and fraud.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Agnelli has been caught up in a corruption scandal. In 2017, he was fined for his role in an earlier match-fixing scheme.</p>
<h1 id="Juventus-FC-president-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-his-role-in-sports-betting-ring"><a href="#Juventus-FC-president-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-his-role-in-sports-betting-ring" class="headerlink" title="Juventus FC president sentenced to 5 years in prison for his role in sports betting ring"></a>Juventus FC president sentenced to 5 years in prison for his role in sports betting ring</h1><p>The President of Juventus Football Club, Andrea Agnelli, was sentenced to 5 years in prison by an Italian court on Thursday for his role in a sports betting ring.</p>
<p>Agnelli is the most prominent figure to be caught up in a crackdown on illegal gambling by Italian authorities that has also resulted in the arrest of dozens of people, including players and other club officials.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had accused Agnelli of knowingly providing false information to authorities about the sale of tickets to Russian fans which were then used for gambling purposes.</p>
<p>“Agnelli is guilty of…favoring illegal betting on sporting matches,” the court said in its ruling.</p>
<p>In a statement released after the verdict, Juventus said it “notes with astonishment that the president is being blamed for having promoted, among others, the interests of fans of his own club”.</p>
